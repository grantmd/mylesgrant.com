Ended up being a great show.  It was a Wednesday night in Oxford, so there were only like 30-40 people there to see the show, and about a third of those were me and my friends.

Jack Friday played for about an hour.  They seemed a little off, probably because of the lack of attendance.  They were also complaining about the mix... couldn't hear the vocals enough, apparently.  Regardless, we still did a lot of dancing.  In fact, by the time they were done playing, I was so exhausted and sweaty that I almost just wanted to go home.  We decided to stick around for a little and check out Johnny Socko, though, and I'm really glad we did.

Johnny Socko was just incredible.  They too were disappointed in the lack of turnout, but that didn't stop them from having a good time.  They tried to get the crowd involved with a dance contest (sort of) and some of those ""get the crowd to sing the lyrics back to you"" things.  My favorite songs that they played while we were there were: ""Rocks In My Head"", a great high-energy jam, and ""Old School Master"", a rap tribute to old-school video games.  Best part of ""Old School Master"" is when they play the old Mario theme.  Oh, and ""When I say 'Donkey', you say, 'Kong!'  'Donkey!'  'Kong!'  'Donkey!'  'Kong!'""  Favorite member of Socko?  <a href=""http://www.johnnysocko.com/demian.htm"">Demian</a>.  That's a hell of a fro there, buddy.

So, anyway, after listening to them for about an hour, all of us were too damned tired to dance anymore, so we left.  We went back to the porch at Game On, which is the house where Erin and everyone else who came to the show with us lives.  <a href=""http://www.jackfriday.com/mattbioframe.htm"">Matt</a>, the guitarist from Jack Friday, came over too and he and I chatted about stuff for a while.  All in all a very good night.  Thanks to both bands for a great show.  Hope to see you all again soon.

I'd have to agree at least partly with that, but I also think that NBC's coverage just mostly stinks this year.  I mean, Klete Keller got bronze in the 400m freestyle, and he won it by only one one-hundreth of a second.  He also came up from dead last with a hundred to go to get third.  After looking at the results <a href=""http://www.olympics.com/"">online</a>, it looked like it would be a great race to watch.  Much to my disappointment, however, NBC didn't even show him finish!  Worse still, they barely even mentioned the fact that he got bronze.  It was an incredible swim, an incredible finish, and NBC really dropped the ball on that one.  They'll be getting an angry letter from me, and I suggest that you write one if you didn't like the coverage either.

You can now click on each pictures' thumbnail to get the full version.  Also, I added a few pictures to the page from '<a href=""/about/myfriends.php#game_on"">Crazy Headgear Night</a>' which we had a few weekends back.  Make sure to check them out.

Interesting weekend that was, beacuse it also marked the first time that I've ever thrown someone out of a party.  Saturday night (Sunday morning) at around 2:00-ish, we were still sitting in the front yard, and most people had gone home.  Suddenly we noticed that there was this guy sitting there with us that no one knew.  Everyone was like, ""When did this guy get here?  Who is he?""  He wasn't talking to anyone... just sitting there.

So we all decided to go inside to the house, and maybe he'd just leave.  Of course, he didn't.  He just sat there.  By that time, two of the other guys that were there had gone down and they were sitting on his left talking to him, so I went down to join them.  I sat on his right (box him in! strategy!) and the two other guys introduced me to our new friend.  Apparently his name was Scott and he was from Ross, OH.  So we talked to him some more, asking him what he was up to, what were his plans, how was he getting home, etc.  Scott informed us that he couldn't go home because someone had stolen his car.  I know!  What an unlucky incident!  When asked why he didn't go to the police, Scott claimed that he had several warrants out for his arrest, and thusly couldn't exactly afford to go talking to the police.

It was at this point that we decided to take him to the party next door, whose hosts we knew, and just kinda drop him off there.  After convincing Scott that there would be a ton of women to 'hook up with' next door, we headed over.  Me and my two cohorts lead the way, walked into the party, out the rear, and then back around front, hoping that we had lost him.  Scott was talking to an unlucky/unwilling female out front when we came through, but we were still golden as long as he didn't see us. Unfortunately, someone out front recognized one of the guys I was with, and we were forced to stop.

We told this guy about what we were doing, and he kindly offered his services:  ""What, you want something to happen to this guy?  You want me to rough him up?""  Well, no, we didn't need that, but we could still just kick him out.  So this guy called Scott over and asked him what his name was.  He replied, ""Ross.""  Well, understandably, this confused me, so I asked him where he was from.  ""Hamilton, OH,"" was his answer.  ""Interesting,"" I told him as we formed a circle around him (more strategy!), ""since that's different from what you just told us over there.""

He stuck to his answer though, as well as the stolen car/warrants defense.  At this point, someone asked him who he knew there.  He didn't know anyone.  It was then explained to him that everyone there was a bunch of friends, and no one really wanted him just crashing there since he couldn't get home.  There was still no indication that Scott/Ross was getting any of this, though, and so I decided to spell it out for him.  ""Listen, Ross, there's a walkway right there that goes down to the sidewalk.  I suggest that you follow it down to the sidewalk and then walk down that until you get Uptown.  And have a nice night.""  The circle opened up slightly, allowing a way out, and Scott/Ross reluctantly took it, stopping twice to turn and look at us, saying, ""Nice guys.""  We stood our ground, though, and watched him go until he was out of sight.

Yeah, I'm hard. :)

"Myles Grant","I Try To Win Something For the First Time In My Life","i_try_to_win_something_for_the_first_time_in_my_life","<a href=""http://www.tivo.com/"">TiVo</a> is running a contest now, <a href=""http://giveaway.tivo.com/giveaway/"">The Great TiVo Giveaway</a>, where they're giving away 10 units a day until the end of October.  All you have to do is write a 250 word essay.  After <a href=""http://www.frantic.org/"">Mike</a> won one today, I was inspired to enter as well.  My essay, which is 242 words:

<blockquote>How often do I miss my favorite shows?  All the time.  I've gotten so busy with this Internet nonsense, that I hardly watch TV anymore.  It's only when the 'net's down that I have time to watch TV.  Of course, what's on when I'm available for TV watching?  Absolutely nothing.

What would be great would be a device that records my favorite shows, whenever they're on, and saves them up for those almost unendurable ""no 'net"" periods.  Something even better would be a device that would allow me to fast-forward (like say, 60x) through all those lame commercials.  Surely such a gadget could never exist.  Those evil TV execs would never let us watch television whenever we wanted to without commercials.

Oh, how silly that thought was.  Fortunately, one of those times that I was watching my TV, there was this extremely humorous commercial on about a new device called a TiVo.  A machine that not only provides me with the ability to watch whatever I want, whenever I want, but also allows me to pause live TV for those ""Bathroom!  Now!"" incidents, replay a really funny Simpsons joke - instantly, and see what is on right now that fits my tastes.

To own a TiVo would be such a joy, but alas, I am but a poor college student with several student loans that cannot afford one right now (although they're very affordable).  If only they were giving them away.  Hmmm.</blockquote>

But when I tried to enter it through the TiVo contest website, their system told me that it was more than 250 words!  Well, I couldn't trim anymore, so I entered the following in there, which is 99 words:

<blockquote>I wrote this really creative and humorous essay.  It was a prize-winner for sure.  Word says my essay is exactly 242 words, but you say it's more than 250.  What's up with that?  I like TiVo.  I want a TiVo.  Why won't you let me get a TiVo?  It has pause live TV capability, it has instant replay, it records all my favorite shows, whenever they're on, and it runs Linux!  That's sweet, and I'd like to have one, but the barriers of technology are not allowing me my fair chance!  I guess I'll just have to give up.
</blockquote>

Think I'll win?

"Myles Grant","The Pay-Per-Class&trade; System: A Proposition","the_pay_per_class_system_a_proposition","I have three classes that have attendance policies.  In each class, I am <i>allowed</i> to miss two classes without excuses.  Every unexcused absence after then will result in a certain amount of points being taken off my grade.  This is bull.

Let's say that you buy season tickets for your <a href=""http://www.azdiamondbacks.com/"">favorite baseball team</a>.  On Opening Day, you, along with every other season ticket holder, receives a syllabus that in part describes the team's attendance policy.  ""You are allowed to miss two games per season,"" it states, ""after which you will be charged $5 per unexcused absence.""  Would you stand for this?  No, of course not, because you payed for those tickets, and attend or not, the team still gets your money.

So why are there these attendance policies in universities.  I already gave them my money.  The teacher is not losing salary if I don't show.  It's my choice, so why should I be punished automatically of that choice?  If I fail the class, that's my fault.  Miami University says that the purpose of attendance policies is to ensure that students do not skip classes, fall behind, and fail.  Well isn't that considerate of them?  Most college students should be responsible enough to make that decision on their own.

That's why I propose the Pay-Per-Class&trade; system.  Under that system, every student would be required to swipe their ID every time they attend class.  At the end of the semester, the university would refund students for the classes that they did not attend.  That way, if I have an easy class (like PHY111) that I can still get a good grade in without attending class, then I just got a great deal.  On the other hand, if I skip class a lot and consequently fail the class, at least I didn't waste a lot of money on it.

I know what you're thinking.  ""But Myles, won't that cause the university to lose a lot of money?""  Well maybe at first, but in the long run, I think that it will force the university and professors to create better classes, which will draw more students to the university, and those students will regularly attend class because it's valuable.  And isn't that what we should be paying for?  A good education?

What do you think?

It'll let them communicate with all their space probes and such through a series of orbiting satellites and ground stations on nearby planets, using regular internet protocols.  The best part about this is that ground crew here doesn't have to wait for specific windows to open to send and receive information from spacecraft; they simply send it out on the internet and let it transmit it around through the various routers until it gets to the destination.

(This was on Metafilter, which by me was daily read.)

Of course, with SeasonPass, TrickPlay, and other special toys,
TiVo is a handy device for all the girls and boys.

Record all your favorite shows, pause live TV,
A proud owner of a TiVo is who I'd like to be.

Alas, poor me, I have no money with which to buy this device,
To receive a TiVo for free (well, $9.95/month) surely would be nice.

So with this brilliant poem, I put forth this plea,
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please give me a TiVo for free.

For I have many friends and family who are just itching to spend some bucks,
And if I don't win this contest, I'll be sure to tell them, ""TiVo sucks!"" :)

<blockquote><i>Why did the chicken cross the road?</i>

<b>Vice Pres. Gore</b>
I fight for the chickens and I am fighting for the chickens right now.  I will not give up on the chickens crossing the road!  I will fight for the chickens and I will not disappoint them.

<b>Gov. G.W. Bush</b>
I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road.  I say give the road to the chickens and let them decide.  The government needs to let go of strangling the chickens so they can get across the road.

<b>Sen Lieberman</b>
I believe that every chicken has the right to worship his or her God in his or her own way.  Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no chicken should be denied the right to cross the road in his or her own way.

<b>Secretary Cheney</b>
Chickens are big-time because they have wings.  They could fly if they wanted to.  Chickens don't want to cross they road.  They don't need help crossing the road. In fact, I'm not interested in crossing the road myself.

<b>Ralph Nader</b>
Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil tire makers.  Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tire makers to create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with chickens.

<b>Pat Buchanan</b>

To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

<b>Jerry Falwell</b>
Because the chicken was gay! Ian't it obvious? Can't you people see the plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the ""other side""  That's what ""they"" call the ""other side"". Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal  media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like ""the other side.""  That chicken shoud not be free to cross the road. It's as plain and simple as that.

<b>Dr. Seuss</b>
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

<b>Ernest Hemingway</b>
To die.  In the rain.

<b>Martin Luther King, Jr.</b>
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross with out having their motives called into question.

<b>Grandpa</b>
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us

<b>Aristotle</b>
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road

<b>Karl Marx</b>

It was an historical inevitability

<b>Saddam Hussein</b>
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

<b>Ronald Reagan</b>
What chicken?

<b>Captain James T. Kirk</b>
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

<b>Fox Mulder</b>
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes.  How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it.?

<b>Freud</b>
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

<b>Bill Gates</b>
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

<b>Einstein</b>

Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?

<b>Bill Clinton</b>
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by ""chicken""?  Could you define ""chicken"" please?

<b>George Bush</b>
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

<b>Louis Farrakhan</b>
The road, you will see, represents the black man.  The chicken crossed the ""black man"" in order to trample him and keep him down.

<b>The Bible</b>
And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, ""Thou shalt cross the road.""  And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.

<b>Colonel Sanders</b>
I missed one?

"Myles Grant","40 Days and 40 Nights","40_days_and_40_nights","My room flooded today.  Waves of water came crashing down from my toilet, destroying everything in its path.  Ok, not really, but apparently it was pretty close, and no, it wasn't because I clogged the toilet.

See, the plunger in my toilet that regulates water flowing into the tank broke on Friday, allowing water to continuously flow into the tank after I flushed.  Smart college-student-guy that I am, I caught onto this after it happened <b>twice</b> (minor spillage both times) and began turning off the water after each flush.

So today I put a note on the repair board that my toilet was broken and promptly went to class.  For the most part, the rest of this is speculation since I haven't been able to talk to our housing manager yet, but I'm almost positive that this is accurate:  Mr. Hall Fix-It Man sees the note on the board.  Goes into my bathroom.  Fiddles with toilet.  Sees that water is turned off and says, ""Ah-ha!  That must be it!""  Turns water on and leaves room.  Aquatic carnage ensued.

The rest of the story I know.  The water rushed out of the bathroom and onto my hardwood floor.  It began to soak into everything on the floor of my room, and since I'm a college student, that means everything in my room.  The water also permeated through the floor, into my adviser's suite below, causing chunks of plaster to fall off the ceiling, critically injuring her iron, but nothing else.  Said water decided to flow into the phone/cable/ethernet conduit on the side of my room, travelled down its length to the box in the lobby, and spurted out the box.

Of course, at this time, someone saw this, thought that probably wasn't right, and gave the right people a call.  They came in, turned off the water, mopped it all up, took away my carpets (presumably for cleaning), and started some fans running in my room.  Oh, and they actually <b>fixed</b> the toilet this time.

Luckily there was no damage to anything important.  Everything's dry now.  They also left me a nice message telling me what happened (sorta).  I guess I'm lucky that more damage wasn't done, but it was still a pretty stupid situation.  Now I'm going to go find my carpets.

I thoroughly annoyed Erin by constantly dispensing my wealth of knowledge about the sport.  It was a good time though, and for what it's worth, Miami beat both teams.

Oh, and when paging through the program, I noticed <a href=""http://www.valpo.edu/athletics/swim_roster.htm"">a member of Valpo's team</a> who was from Phoenix, AZ.  His name?  Stefan Hoffmeister.  Some of you might remember him as Hoffy Hoffmeister.  Cherie pointed him out to me, though, and I must say that I don't recognize him.  He looked right at me a few times and didn't recognize me either, though.  Cherie even asked him if he remembered a Myles Grant from Phoenix and he said no.

Well here in Ohio, we say, ""It's not the cold, it's the damn wind.""  Honestly, I could stand the sub-freezing temperatures outside if the air was absolutely calm.  But when that wind starts moving, even at 1 mph, fugetaboutit.  It makes it so much worse.

To combat this growing problem, I have begun to change the way that I go to class.  Before, I would find the most direct route between where I was and where I was headed.  I would then follow that route, making my trip the most efficient possible.  Under this method, buildings are typically an obstacle... something to be avoided at all costs.  Not so with my new system.

Now when I go to class, I pick the path that has the highest number of buildings in it.  Then, when I reach a building, I go inside it, walk through to the other side, and then reenter the frigid air, continuing on my journey.  Repeat.  This morning, for example, I walked through three separate buildings on my way to my eight-o'clock.  This typically adds a few minutes to my trip time, and it bothers my constant need for efficiency, but I'll be damned if the few ""pitstops"" of warm air along the way aren't worth it.

Allow me to make it perfectly clear, <b>I have absolutely no problem with the current Brophy administration.</b>  I get along extremely well with both Fr. Reese and Mr. Hearn.  In fact, Fr. Reese and I regularly ""talk"" on Instant Messenger, with Fr. Reese asking me questions that prove that he cares about me.  In addition, every time that I go back to Phoenix and have the occasion to speak with Mr. Hearn (like at Brophy Mass, for example), he is always extremely kind to me.  He asks how I'm doing, and tells me how his sons and family are doing.

So what bothers me about <a href=""http://restorebrophy.com/"">restorebrophy.com</a> is not that ""they"" are expressing views that are different from mine, it's that they are so cowardly in doing so.  Dissenting views are one of the cornerstones of an intelligent society, but it only works if you are courageous enough to stand behind your words.  Most of the people who post on restorebrophy.com, from the ""webmaster"" on down, hide behind aliases.  They say that it's because they're afraid of retribution.  Well, I'm sorry, but to hell with fear of retribution.  If you feel strongly enough about something, openly speak your mind... otherwise, hold your tongue.  Hiding who you are forces people to look at you with a lot less credibility, and then you've accomplished nothing.

I remember back when I first looked at that site (maybe almost a year ago?), the forums were full of a heated exchange between those who were critical of the administration and hid their identities, and those who were supportive of the administration and critical of the site but openly stated who they were.  Sure there were a few people who crossed those lines, but for the most part, that was true.  Looking at the site today, however, I notice that most of the posts by those critical of the site itself are gone.  Why?  The first reason is that the webmaster has been deleting those posts.  Take a look around the forums for a little bit, and you'll notice that.  The second reason is that now the forums require you to register with the webmaster before you are allowed to post.  This requires you to send your name, e-mail address (verifiable), and zip code to the webmaster.  So why is it that the webmaster gets to know who everyone is, but no one else is?  I see a large opportunity for abuse here.  I guess it all depends on whether or not you trust the webmaster, but how can you trust someone if they won't even tell you who they are?

I mentioned credibility above, and I'd like to get back to that.  As far as credibility goes, restorebrophy.com has <b>none</b>.  The site's admin(s) and users hide behind aliases.  They delete posts from people who disagree with them (even though they state on the front page that it's ""A public forum"".  ""<a href=""http://www.restorebrophy.com/chapters.html"">The Chapters in a History of Decline</a>"" are provided without sources or supporting information.  The pages are ugly and poorly formatted.  The site contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors.  ""<a href=""http://www.restorebrophy.com/petition.html"">The Online Petition</a>"" sends an unsolicited e-mail to ""Father Smolich, Provincial of the California Province of the Society of Jesus"" (that's SPAM, and it's illegal since it does not provide a way for Fr. Smolich to opt-out of future mailings).  ""<a href=""http://www.restorebrophy.com/attrition.html"">The Attrition Page</a>"" purports (in part) to list faculty members who have been forced out by the current administration, but also contains a number of people who have left on their own accord and in good terms with the administration.  That's just misleading.  In some places, they claim to have ""physical evidence"" and ""people who will come forward"", but where/what is this evidence, and who are these people?  Finally, content is duplicated in several different sections of the site, making it look larger than it really is.

All these things erode their credibility to the point where there's just none left.  They appear to be just a bunch of pissed off people who can't stand the fact that they're not right anymore, and they want to take it out on a big (and easy) target.  They're just too gutless to say it to their faces.  I have no patience for that.

"Myles Grant","Automobile Dreams","automobile_dreams","For the longest time, I wanted a <a href=""http://www.chevrolet.com/suburban/"">Suburban</a> or a <a href=""http://www.chevrolet.com/tahoe/"">Tahoe</a>.  Stupid, I know.  Gas-guzzling, person-trampling, carbon-monoxide spewing giant metal box.  But I wanted one.  I grew out of it about halfway through college and graduated into <a href=""http://www.bmwusa.com/"">BMW</a> lust.

I drive pretty fast.  Not dangerously fast, but faster than a lot of people, and I wanted something with acceleration, with power.  Something that would respond when I hit the accelerator on the freeway, not mope along while I got run down by all the damn Suburbans and Tahoes.

But, of course, I couldn't afford one right out of college.  So I got <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/corolla/"">a Corolla</a>.  Which is pretty good considering I was looking at <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/echo/"">an Echo</a> (excuse me, <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/echo/"">an ECHO</a>).  Unfortunately, I absolutely needed a car <b>right then</b>, so I couldn't get the color I wanted.  So much disappointment.

The Corolla's great, though.  Runs well.  Solidly built.  Good mileage.  Manual transmission so I can force it to accelerate when I want.  I couldn't ask for a better car at this point in my life.

Which is why the <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/prius/"">Toyota Prius</a> is infuriating me.  I want one so bad.  I ache for it.  But it's not fast.  It doesn't have punch.  And it looks weird.  Why do I want one?

Part of it is this 12-18 month upgrade cycle I'm used to from computers.  It just seems natural that I've had my car for a little over a year, so it's time to upgrade.  There's nothing wrong with my car, aside from a few scratches, but it's <i>old</i>.  I want new technology.  I want a Prius!

The other reason I'm attracted to it is <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2004/prius/features.html"">the features</a> (are the features?).  A car that <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2004/prius/key_features/smart_entry.html"">recognizes me as the owner</a>, unlocking the car as I approach and allowing me to start the car at the push of a button.  No keys.  Awesome.  <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2004/prius/key_features/safety.html"">Side curtain</a> airbags to keep me and <a href=""/braindump/older/2003/10/16/wedding_bells.html"">my loved one(s)</a> safe.  6-disc in-dash CD changer with nine speakers in seven locations for those long drives to IKEA.  Voice-activated DVD navigation system with hands-free phone capability via Bluetooth.  A car that talks to my phone!  60 mpg city/51 mpg highway.  Better mileage in the city, which covers the vast majority of my driving.  And it's twice as good as my current mileage.  It would save me, at least, $160 a year in fuel costs.  That's money I can spend at IKEA!

Not to mention the benefits to the environment.  Phoenix has terrible, terrible smog, especially in the summer.  The Prius is <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2004/prius/key_features/hybrid_syn_drive.html"">perfect for city driving</a>, recycling energy every time you brake (often), and not emitting anything while you're stopped (often), because the engine is off.

<a href=""http://www.valleyconnections.com/"">Phoenix's Light Rail</a> is scheduled to open in 3 years and a few days.  I think that by then a combination of increasing income by me and decreasing prices by Toyota could enable me to buy one.  And the light rail would allow me to drive even less, saving more money in fuel costs.  I can't wait.

"Myles Grant","Whuffie","whuffie","A couple months ago I read <a href=""http://www.craphound.com/"">Cory Doctorow's</a> 2003 novel <a href=""http://www.craphound.com/down/"">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765304368/mylesgrantcom-20"">Buy it at Amazon</a>, <a href=""http://www.craphound.com/down/download.php"">Download it for free</a>).  If you like scifi or Disneyworld at all, I highly recommend it.

One of the most interesting concepts in Down and Out is ""Whuffie"".  What's Whuffie?  Well, most people enjoy doing things for other people for free. Why? It gives them a sense of charity, goodwill, accomplishment, respect, props, karma, etc. You do something for someone else, and they owe you a favor. Over time, those favors zero out, making your investment come back to you equally. In the future, when all material wants and needs are taken care of free of charge, this is what gives people incentive. Why work as a bartender? Because patrons will give you Whuffie, in exchange for a drink. Why write a symphony? To receive Whuffie from appreciative listeners. Why create a free-of-charge community website? Whuffie.

And what good is Whuffie? Well, it's of the same usefulness as reputation. It opens doors, it eases new social relationships, it gets you free stuff. In a world where everyone's Whuffie, or rep, is currently, globally available, you know instantly whether each person you meet is worth your time. It may sound unfair, but it's more fair than the bouncer who lets another guy into the club instead of you, just because the other guy slipped him a fifty.

In today's economy, you can work hard all your life and still not make enough money to be able to afford that fifty dollar bribe. But in a reputation economy, that's not the case. Anyone can give you Whuffie, freely, for your hard work, resulting in an even playing field. A globally available, freely given currency means prosperity for all, if you want it. As long as you can do something, anything worthy of respect, and as long as you have friends, you will never, ever be poor.

The world isn't ready for a reputation economy like Whuffie just yet, but it is ready for an experiment.  Many similar offline labor-based currencies, like <a href=""http://www.lightlink.com/hours/ithacahours/"">Ithaca HOURs</a>, <a href=""http://www.timedollar.org/"">Time Dollars</a>, and <a href=""http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/"">LETSystems</a> have proven successful, but it's time for an online currency.  We already have freely available <a href=""http://www.opsound.org/"">music</a>, <a href=""http://openphoto.net/"">photos</a>, <a href=""http://www.eldritchpress.org/"">text</a>, <a href=""http://www.sourceforge.net/"">code</a>, and <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/"">courseware</a>.  Not to mention an army of bloggers, just begging for reputation, and usually game for new technologies, ideas, and experiments.  All we need is a freely available, programmable, open system of a reputation currency.

Why am I ranting about this?  For my own benefit, of course.  This kind of stuff just fascinates me for some reason, and the Whuffie concept rang so true, that I decided to create yet another side project of mine: <a href=""http://whuffie.net/"">whuffie.net</a>.

CBS lobbied hard for this rule change; MoveOn.org members across the country lobbied against it; and now the MoveOn.org ad has been rejected while the White House ad will be played. It looks an awful lot like CBS is playing politics with the right to free speech.

Of course, this is bigger than just the MoveOn.org Voter Fund. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) submitted an ad that was also rejected.

Normally if you ask me, I'll tell you that I don't like living in Phoenix.  That I preferred growing up here, when there were fewer cars and more horses.  Fewer roads and more open space.  Less smog and more clean air.  Fewer rich, conceited yuppies and more people who worked hard and really loved living here.  And I do miss the ""old days"" here.  This city has definately gone down hill.

Even though Phoenix is one of the biggest cities in the country, it doesn't have the character that its peers have.  It's so spread out, that it doesn't have that big city feel.  But it has lost the wild west personality that would have set it apart from the other big dogs.

You know what though?  It's not that bad.

You can still ride horses through the desert, if you know where to go.  The sky's still crystal clear some days, and the pollution contributes to some amazing sunsets.  And some people still wear cowboy hats.  Not to mention the unending sunshine and beautiful year-round weather.  There are definately worse places to live.

So I want to talk more about Arizona here.  About the things that do set this state apart from the other 49.  Because I believe that if we focus on the good things from both the past and the future, this will become a state to love again.

And that's what this new site design is about.  It's about setting the tone.

"Myles Grant","Snap to Grid","snap_to_grid","One of the first things new visitors to Phoenix notice is how easy it is to get around here.  If you give me an address, any address, in Phoenix, I can probably find it -- even if I've never been anywhere near it.  This is thanks to the original city planners' genius idea of mapping out all the streets on a grid.

<a href=""/images/central_phoenix_map.gif""><img src=""/images/central_phoenix_map.gif"" height=""324"" width=""425"" alt=""Map of Central Phoenix"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" /></a>

Above you see a map of Phoenix's ground zero: Central Ave and Washington St (<b>Click it to get a slightly larger, non-smushed version</b>).  This is 0,0 on Phoenix's road grid.  Knowing this, and a few other bits of information, you can get anywhere.

Let's talk about streets and avenues first.  Roads that are to the east and parallel to Central Ave are the Streets, and are numbered sequentially starting at 1st Street.  Likewise, roads that are to the west and parallel to Central Ave are the Avenuea and are numbers sequentiall starting at 1st Avenue.  You can see this on the map above (east is right and west is left).

Roads north and south of Washington St work on a similar design.  So from the map above, Adams St. is 100 North.  Monroe is 200 North.  Jefferson is 100 South.  And so on.  The 100s are considered fairly small roads.  The big guys are 1000, 2000, 3000, etc north and south.  Example: Northern Avenue is 8000 North.

So now we have our points on the graph.  Given any address, we can plot it on the graph, and then drive there.  Example:  8626 N. 10th Avenue.  We know that 10th Avenue is west of Central.  And from the example above we know that Northern is 8000 North.  So we know that 8626 N. 10th Avenue is 10 avenues west of Central, and between Northern and Dunlap, because Dunlap is 9000 North.

Once you've been here a little while, this becomes incredibly easy.  Again, for example, I know that the major avenues are Central, Seventh, and 19th.  And I know that Butler Ave is directly between Northern and Dunlap (making it 8500 North).  So to get to 8626 N. 10th Avenue from the south, I would go north on 7th Avenue to Butler, turn left (west) on Butler to 10th Avenue, turn right (north) on 10th Avenue, and drive North to my destination.

Believe me, this is easy.  And it's made infinitely easier by the fact that all streets (with a few exceptions) run completely straight.  So if you know where 8626 N. 10th Ave. is, you can infer that 16601 N. 10th Ave. is exactly north of that address (and roughly twice as far from Washington St as 8626 is).  I should also add that usually when streets do curve (to go around a mountain or a big sports arena), they end up back on the straight line they left, eventually.

<img src=""/images/central_phoenix_map-large.gif"" height=""353"" width=""463"" alt=""Map of Central Phoenix"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" />

In the map above, which is a zoomed-out version of the top map, you'll see that Jefferson St. curves south to hit the America West Arena and Bank One Ballpark, and then curves back up north to get back in line.

The city planners who made this design were genius's.  But to be fair, there are other cities in the US which are based on this design.  The difference is that Phoenix, despite its exponential growth, has kept this design all the way out to the edges, while other cities have abandoned it.

Ah, yes.  Now you remember.

Anyway, due to overwhelming demand for me to release the code, I'm now doing so.  And by ""overwhelming demand"", I mean some guy emailed me asking about it -- and his email came sans return address so I can't even let him know.

Before we get to the download, though, a few self-conscious disclaimers: I wrote this code off and on over a couple days, and I wasn't even sure it would work when I started, so it pretty much sucks.  Mostly, I'm disappointed that I didn't write it as a class, so it's not extendible easily.  Also, it's pretty tightly integrated with my needs here, so I can't guarantee that it will fit yours.  Regardless, here it is, and if it helps you, I'm glad.

We have two choices here, a <a href=""/files/imageUpload/imageUpload-0.1.tar.gz"">10,842 byte gzipped-tar</a>, and <a href=""/files/imageUpload/imageUpload-0.1.zip"">a byte 14,011 zip file</a>.  Pick your poison and go nuts.

I should also note that I think they're working on getting a Nokia Image Uploader class in the <a href=""http://pear.php.net/"">PEAR packages</a>, so this might all be somewhat pointless.  Then again, I know the submission was getting bogged down in PEAR's trademark anal-retentiveness, so it might not ever happen.  Just thought I'd share.

It just gets to a point where you're filling in forms over and over again.  You're spamming your friends over and over again.  You're reading message boards over and over again.  Unless you're looking for a date, or a business contact, it's just not fun after a while.

It seems that <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/"">Flickr</a>, announced yesterday, is different.

I played <a href=""http://gne.net/"">GNE</a> for a while when it first came out, and while it wasn't really my cup of tea, I was impressed by just how <i>usable</i> it was.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/"">Flickr</a> feels the same way.  The interface just feels more comfortable.  It's certainly more flashy, but not overly so.  You spend less time filling in textareas and more time uploading and sharing photos, or <i>actively</i> chatting with friends (instead of making message board posts).  It's the little touches, like the random greetings on the front page, in different languages, that make this piece of social software (there, I said it) special.

So I definately recommend that you check it out.  I'm not going to invite you, because you're probably tired of it.  But if you do sign up, you can add me as a friend.  My email address is flickr AT mylesgrant DOT com.

That said, I'm probably going to get bored with it too.

We both watched the show last night and found out how wrong we were about the process.  Matt was <b>not</b> one of the final eight.  He was one of the final 32.  So only two of the eight Matt was in were chosen to go on to the next round.  And then they do that again three more times to decide on a final eight.  Matt was not one of the two chosen by viewers to go on to the next round.  He let <a href=""http://www.idolonfox.com/contestants/diana_degarmo/index.htm"">a sixteen year old</a> beat him.

But wait!  There's more!

As <a href=""http://www.galactichero.net/"">Stephanie</a> has patiently explained to my n00bish self, there are ""wild cards"".  After the top eight are chosen over the next 3 weeks, the judges pick eight more people to perform one more time.  From those chosen eight, the judges nominate four to join the other eight, making a new top twelve.  Sheesh!

So Matt's not finished.  The judges seem to like him, and Steph thinks he'll make it to the top twelve.  And she's an expert, so listen to her.

Now I have to talk about this all again in four weeks when Matt (maybe) comes back on the show.

I can't pinpoint exactly when that changed, but it might have been that magical 2000 presidential election.  Since then I've become increasingly awareof just how important following politics is.  I read the always excellent <a href=""http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/"">TPM</a>, <a href=""http://atrios.blogspot.com/"">Eschaton</a>, <a href=""http://www.calpundit.com/"">Calpundit</a>, and <a href=""http://www.oliverwillis.com/"">OWillis</a> every day.

I'm a contributing member of <a href=""http://moveon.org/"">MoveOn</a>, the <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/"">DNC</a>, the <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/"">ACLU</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.eff.org/"">EFF</a>.  I've written letters to, and received responses from, my senators and congressmen.  I listen to <a href=""http://www.npr.org/"">NPR</a> to and fro work every day.

Most importantly: I vote.  There was a time when I might have bothered voting in a presidential election --if I had the time.  Now, I don't miss a single election, no matter how small.  And I love it.  There's no better feeling than making your opinions heard.  If you don't vote, I'm sorry, but there's something wrong with you.

I have very little doubt that the 2004 presidential election will be the most important election of my lifetime.  The Bush Administration's policies, lies, and political games have put America in real danger, and this is our only chance to do something about it.  From the <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?as_q=valerie+plame&as_sitesearch=talkingpointsmemo.com"">Valerie Plame business</a>, to <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=dick+cheney+haliburton"">Haliburton</a>, to the Iraq war mess, to the <a href=""http://uggabugga.blogspot.com/2004_02_22_uggabugga_archive.html#107791802898785297"">9/11 commission stonewalling</a>, and to the <a href=""http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/luckovich/2004/022504.html"">ridiculous Gay Marriage Amendment</a>, I don't see how anyone can support these thugs.  But people don't read as much about this as I do, and so I understand.  This is still going to be a fight, and it's going to be ugly, very ugly, very soon.

I supported Dean in the beginning, and I believe that he has done a tremendous, and necessary good for the Democratic Party and for the country.  I secondarily supported Edwards.  But now that Kerry is the de facto nominee, he has my full support.  And the <a href=""http://www.presidentmatch.com/"">AOL President Match tool</a> has me at 99% in line with Kerry's policies (behind Kucinich and Sharpton, ouch!).  I'm only an 18% match with Bush.

So this morning I donated my first amount to the Kerry campaign.  I'll follow this election closely, and in November, I'll vote against George W. Bush.  It should be a pretty easy win for Kerry.  And then, I'll start this whole thing over again, because even though I'm currently a registered Democrat, and a supporter of the party's nominee, that can easily change.  I've never been a fan of a two-party system, because it limits our choices.  I'd like to see that change.

Regardless, I'd like to talk about politics a little more on here.  We'll see how that goes.

"Myles Grant","Wireless Mayhem","wireless_mayhem","<p>I've been working on (and sometimes ignoring) a rewrite of <a href=""/braindump/older/2004/02/07/phpmysql_nokia_image_upload_server_01_release.html"">my Nokia Image Upload Server</a> code, but that isn't the only thing that's been happening with my phone.</p>

<p>You'll notice that <a href=""/photos/gallery.html?id=24"">I've been snapping images with it as fast as ever</a>, and if you're even more eagle-eyed you might be able to tell that the images are a little more clearer.  There's a reason for this, of course, but like with any good reason, there's an even better story behind it.</p>

<p>Two Fridays ago (April 2nd), Erin and I went to the first <a href=""http://www.diamondbacks.com/"">Diamondbacks</a> game this year at <a href=""http://www.bankoneballpark.com/"">Bank One Ballpark</a>.  This was not the season opener, because it was just an exhibition game, but it was the first game in the park this season.  But I digress.  During the game, I took and uploaded <a href=""/photos/photo.html?id=74"">this picture</a>.  Shortly afterwards, I put my phone in my pocket.  After we left the game, I removed the phone from my pocket and... it had turned itself off.</p>

<p>Now that by itself is not strange.  My phone turns itself off fairly often, usually after getting bumped on something.  It's possible that I had hit the corner of a stadium seat, or a doorway, or something with the phone in my pocket, knocking the phone unconscious.  So I turned the phone back on...  but it didn't come back up all the way.</p>

<p>What I did get was this message: ""Phone start-up failed.  Contact retailor.""  Not good.  I turned the phone back off and then back on.  No dice.  Pulled the battery out, then tried again.  Nope.  Different combinations of having the sim card and the MMC card in.  Nope.  Fully charged? No love.</p>

<p>The next day, I took the phone into the same AT&T Wireless store where I bought it.  The clerk there took one look at the message on the phone, declared he had seen nothing like it before, and gave me the number for AT&T Wireless' warranty replacement center.</p>

<p>Calling the number got me the same type of reaction.  Lots of reading of numbers off the back of the phone.  Lots of repeating of the start-up message I got.  And bewilderment at what could be causing it.  But they finally decided to send me a new one... with several caveats:</p>

<ol>
<li>The phone <b>may</b> come without a battery cover, faceplate, or keypad.  I should use my existing one to replace missing parts.</li>
<li>Someone needed to be home all day to wait for the UPS man, or it was up to the driver's discretion whether or not to leave me my phone.</li>
<li>I had to put my existing sim and MMC cards and battery into the new phone, and call AT&T Wireless' customer care number to get it activated -- along with that number's standard 30 minute hold time.</li>
<li>I had 48 hours to send back my old phone using the provided shipping materials, or they would charge me for the replacement.</li>
<li>If, upon receiving my old phone, they weren't ""satisfied"" with its condition (too many scratches, etc), they would charge me for the replacement.</li>
</ol>

<p>On Tuesday, I received my new phone.  After getting home from work, I inserted my sim and MMC cards, battery, battery cover, keypad, and faceplate into the new phone, and fired it up.  Lo and behold, it worked!  It even signed right onto the AT&T Wireless network as me, immediately allowing me to place and receive calls -- no call to customer care needed (I understand this is the magic of sim cards).</p>

<p>I was able to send the old phone back using the same box it came in.  They provided a pre-paid shipping label that I could place on top of the old one, and they even gave me a strip of packing tape to seal the box back up with.  A simple trip to the post office to drop it off (no waiting necessary) was all that was needed.  I haven't gotten a bill for the cost of the replacement or anything, but I assume that I won't.  After the initial pain-in-the-ass part of it, they really did a good job of making it easy.</p>

<p>But I can't help thing that it could have been easier...</p>

<p>The woman on the phone from the warranty replacement center diagnosed this as a software problem -- and I agree.  Presumably, my new phone has newer software on it than my old phone, or at least a non-hosed install.  I should have been able to go into my local AT&T Wireless store, and have them reimage my phone right there.  For free.  I had a recent backup of my phone's data (God bless <a href=""http://www.bluetooth.com/"">Bluetooth</a>, eh?), so I didn't really lose anything.  So I would have preferred that  they could just fix it immediately.  And I'm sure they could, technically.  For some reason, though, they choose not not.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to my original point.  I now have a brand new phone (or at least, the bits that matter).  That means that my camera, and lens are unscratched.  Which means my pictures are sharper and clearer.  Yes, that's not very exciting.  Sorry you had to sit through all this just to find that out -- but it's good for you.  Builds character.</p>

Originally, I was thinking about updating <a href=""/braindump/older/2004/07/01/a_list.html"">my list of incomplete tasks</a> in batches -- after I had finished two or three or so.  But I'm thinking that I'll update it every time.  Gives me more frequent content on this site, and a sense of accomplishment.  So, here we go.

<b>A home-made PVR with MythTV.</b>  I'm calling this done.  There's a box in the closet of our office running <a href=""http://www.mythtv.org/"">MythTV</a> now, and I've successfully recorded (and watched) several shows, mostly <a href=""http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/"">The Daily Show</a>.  I don't have the frontend connected to our tv, or anything -- I just watch the shows on my laptop.  But that's as far as current budget allows, so I'm calling it done.  It needs more babysitting than a <a href=""http://www.tivo.com/"">Tivo</a> would, but that's to be expected.  For example, it doesn't seem to want to update its schedule nightly, so I have to do that by hand for now.  And sometimes I need to reboot my laptop to get the frontend to work.  But it records shows, avoids duplicates, works around conflicts, and auto-expires old shows.  Plus, I can schedule stuff through the web interface from wherever, which rocks.

But I kinda cheated.  That was pretty much done, aside from some tweaking, when I made my list.  So to make up for it, I'm going to add another task, and mark it complete.

<b>Ripping out the old cactus-type-thing.</b> This weekend, my Dad came over and helped me chop down this ugly old cactus-type-thing in our front yard.  I <i>think</i> it was dead.  I <i>know</i> it was ugly.  I'm going to try and dig up a picture of it for everybody, just so you can see.  In its place is a large dirt patch, which looks kinda silly surrounded by all the gravel in our yard, but it looks 100 times better than before.  I've had two neighbors thank me for taking it down already.  This was an all day affair that involved axes, saws, a rake, shovels, chainsaws, a wheelbarrow, a hose, a chainsaw, a trip to the dump, blood, sweat, and Dr. Pepper.  Did I mention the chainsaw?  That was rad.  So I think this qualifies as a major project, and thanks to my Dad, it's done.

I'd call that progress, wouldn't you?

Tomorrow I have two tutorials, ""<a href=""http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/4983"">Object Oriented Programming with PHP5</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/5519"">Subversion: Version Control Rethought</a>"", both of which will be incredibly interesting.  This being my first conference, though, I'm unsure how attendance works in these early days.  There's a decent amount of people here for the conference already, even though the first two days are just tutorials.  I assume that come Tuesday evening, the geek population will explode, consuming everything within a two block radius.

So far it's fun, in a this-is-all-new-to-me kinda way.  Hopefully tomorrow I'll get to know some interesting people and learn some fascinating things.  In the meantime, I'll continue to sit here and laugh, watching people try and find registration.  It's hard.

P.S.  I've taken <a href=""/photos/gallery.html?id=30"">some pictures</a> already.  Nothing interesting.  At all.

I had two tutorials yesterday, and two today.  Results were mixed.  Yesterday's first was ""Object Oriented Programming with PHP5"".  This ended up being mostly a review of OOP in general.  Being your standard CS degree holder, this is... well... elementary stuff.  Pretty disappointing.  It was fun, however, to try and count how many times Marcus called something ""stupid"".  Apparently this is fairly standard in Germany, or even anywhere overseas.  The second tutorial was ""Subversion: Version Control Rethought"".

"Myles Grant","Mambo and mod_adsense","mambo_and_mod_adsense","So I've been playing with some software called <a href=""http://www.mamboserver.com/"">Mambo</a> for the past 3 or 4 days.  It basically allows you to run a site pretty much completely from a web browser -- a very full-featured website.  I'm considering it for a couple projects.

Anyway, so far I absolutely love it.  I did have a major install problem, where one of the user tables silently failed on creation, and then I couldn't log in.  Took forever to figure that out.  And some of the things seem a little difficult to learn how to do, but once I determine how to do everything, I'm sure it's going to be totally rad.

It has these things called modules and components that you can plugin to do different things to your site.  Modules are simpler, so I dove into how to make them.  There wasn't one for doing Adsense ads, except for one a guy wrote that he's charging ten bucks for.  So I spent a couple hours and made one -- and I'm giving it away!  If you're interested, you can download version 1.1 of my <a href=""/files/mod_adsense/mod_adsense.zip"">Mambo Adsense module</a>.  If you use it, like it, and feel so inclined, you can drop some money in my <a href=""http://www.dropcash.com/campaign/myles/buy_myles_an_ipod/"">Buy Myles an iPod!</a> fund at <a href=""http://www.dropcash.com/"">Dropcash</a>.

<b>Update:</b> This only works for Mambo 4.5.1, as far as I know.

"Myles Grant","Don't Change Horses Mid Apocalypse","dont_change_horses_mid_apocalypse","If you're going to say something like ""Do not question Dear Leader.  The Leader is always right"", you tend to not just come out and say it -- at least not in what is commonly referred to as a democracy.  Instead, you say things like ""Steady leadership in times of change"".  Or you paint your opponent as a ""flip-flopper"".  As if having the mental acuity and guts to admit that you made a mistake is something to be ashamed of.

But then there's stuff like the billboard I saw out on I-17 tonight.  The upper two-thirds and entire width of the billboard is taken up by the word ""STOP"".  Underneath it, smaller, is ""second guessing and doubting.""  Still underneath that, even smaller, it says ""Support President Bush and our troops.""

<i>STOP second guessing and doubting.  Support President Bush and our troops.</i>

Riiiiiiiggggghhhht.

Cause we all know dissent is bad.  Disagree?  Shut your hole.  As of today there are 1,000 Americans dead in Iraq.  If I thought that supporting President Bush  would keep that number from climbing higher, I would.  But it's not going to.

President Bush got us in this mess.  It was his war -- he went it alone.  Whether or not he lied about the necessity for war (and I think he did), there's no question that it was his decision.  And there's now 1,000+ reasons why that was the wrong one.  More if you count Iraqi civilian casualties.

Sure, people make mistakes.  But the President can't.  If he does, we replace him.  There's a higher standard here.  No such thing as a do-over.  Certainly in a country of 294 million we can find somebody every four to eight years who won't make mistakes that cost the lives of thousands.

This year I think that person is John Kerry, so I'll be voting for him in November.  And when he wins, I will doubt and second guess every decision he makes until I'm satisfied that he's right.  And I hope you do too.

I could go on and on, but I won't just now.  I know I'm a very strong Kerry supporter (and very, very anti-Bush), but I honestly think Kerry did much better.  Bush had a few really strong points (the story about meeting with the wife of a dead soldier sounded really good to half the country, I think), but overall Kerry was stronger.

No real stand-out moments that I noticed, though I didn't watch the whole thing.  It pretty much went the way I expected, and I don't think this is going to change any minds.

Although it sucked that Edwards thanked Cheney for coming, but Cheney didn't thank Edwards.  Also, Bush was hardly ever mentioned -- certainly far less than Kerry was.  Is that because Cheney actually runs things?

Snowbirds -- older folks who spend the more oppressively hot summer months up north (Flagstaff, Payson, Prescott, etc), but return, right on schedule, to enjoy the mild winters in Phoenix.

When I was growing up here, I remember hearing the term Snowbirds, but I didn't really understand it until I started to drive.  Because of my August birthday, I was one of those kids who was older than everyone else in his grade -- so I got my license before everyone else.  Which meant that I drove a lot.  To swim practice.  To school.  To ""gatherings"".  Every day to and from swim practice.  The same way every day at the same time.  I had everything timed and knew exactly when I'd get home.

And then one day, bam!  It seemed like everything was off.  More cars on the road than usual.  <i>Slower</i> cars on the road than usual.  It took me a few days to figure it out, but I finally looked around at all the cars.  Lots of Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs.  Lots of ""10 and 2s"", with spectacled white-haired heads poking up.  That's when I got it.

In the years since, it has gotten more obvious to me.  I still do a lot of driving, the same way every day.  And in early October, the roads suddenly get more crowded.  And they stay that way until June.  A month that can't come soon enough.

"Myles Grant","I Hate ABC","i_hate_abc","<a href=""http://www.abc.com/"">ABC</a> has the two best shows on tv right now: <a href=""http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index.html"">Lost</a> and <a href=""http://abc.go.com/primetime/desperate/index.html"">Desperate Housewives</a>.  (Oh, and <a href=""http://abc.go.com/primetime/xtremehome/index.html"">Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</a> is good too.)  Lost is an incredible bit of storytelling, and Desperate Housewives is strangely compelling for what is basically a comedy.

And that's all well and good, except that they <b>had</b> to F with my schedule.

Lost is on Wednesday nights at 7:00.  This used to mean that the show would start at 7:00 and end at 7:57/58 -- giving you a few minutes to change the channel to your next show, grab some water, or go to the bathroom.  No longer.  Lost starts at 6:58.  It doesn't end until 8:01.  <a href=""http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html"">The West Wing</a> starts at 8:00 (which means 8:00).  So I have two choices: 1) Miss the end of Lost, or 2) Miss the beginning of the West Wing.

So far I have been choosing number 2.  If this keeps up, I will have to play my loyalty card.  Thus far this season, Lost has been marginally better.  But I've been watching The West Wing for years now, and <a href=""http://www.nbc.com/"">NBC</a> doesn't try and screw me.  Tonight The West Wing ended at 8:55, and they had enough time to go to commercial and show scenes from next week's episode before 9:00.

I can think of a few reasons why ABC is doing this:

1)  They don't get a lot of hit shows.  So they're selling an extra couple of minutes worth of commercials during a popular show.

2)  It's such a good show, they want to be able to show a few extra minutes of it, and don't think we'll mind.

3)  They think that if I miss the beginning of The West Wing (or some other 8:00 show), I'll stick around for The Bachelor instead.

4)  People tune in at 8:00 to watch The Bachelor, and catch the end of Lost.  Thinking ""What the hell was that!?"", they might tune in next week to watch it and get hooked.

Or some combination of the above.  No matter the reason, I think it's a losing bet for ABC.  This kind of behavior has only strengthened my desire to get a Tivo-like device.  And then I won't watch commercials at all.  Is that what ABC wants?

In 2000, if all the votes in Florida had been recounted, Gore would have been president.  Kerry is not going to make that same mistake.  And the Republicans exclaiming that Bush won the popular vote this year, so he obviously won re-election, seem to have pretty short memories.  You never know how these provisional ballots will go until you count them.  They could overwhelmingly be the result of Republican poll watcher challenges -- in which case I would expect the Kerry gains to be significant.  Both candidates would be well advised to wait and see how *all* the votes turn out in an election this close.

That said, I'm terrified of a second Bush administration.  America is going to change significantly over the next four years, and I really don't think it's going to be for the better.  Consolidating the executive, legislative, and judicial branches under a single party isn't exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind.

For years many people -- democrats, independents, hippies, activists, but never republicans -- have been calling for Rumsfeld to be fired.  He did a decent job with the invasion of Iraq, but the postwar has gone terribly, horribly wrong.  And that's his fault.  And people, prominant people, have been proclaiming loudly that he needs to be let go.  And Bush has ignored those cries.  Even as recently as a few weeks ago, Bush insisted that Rumsfeld would be staying around for the forseeable future.

And then comes the question from a reporter, via a soldier, in a highly publicized press conference.  And now it's all over the news.  And McCain says he has no confidence.  And Lott says he has no confidence.  Never mind that the issue of our troops not having enough armor has been around for <b>years</b>.  All of a sudden it's a big deal.  And now that prominant republicans are saying something about it, you know what's gonna happen?  Rumsfeld is going to resign.

"Myles Grant","No, I Haven't Posted In A While","no_i_havent_posted_in_a_while","Here's why.

Besides the day job, and chores, and <i>life</i>, I've been working on two projects.

The first was a redesign of my strangely high-traffic site, <a href=""http://www.blogskins.com/"">BlogSkins.com</a>.  I completely redesigned every single page, and I also added a ton of features.  You can <a href=""http://www.blogskins.com/2005/04/new-featuresredesign.php"">read the details here</a>, if you're so inclined.

The hype around <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org/"">Ruby On Rails</a> had me intrigued, so my second project was to do something with it.  What I did was a site called <a href=""http://www.whattheysaid.net/"">What They Said</a>.  The purpose is to be able to see what your congresspeople said about specific topics over time.  I'm still tweaking a number of things, specifically how quotes are identified, but it's pretty well done and it has been a lot of fun.  Check it out and tell me what you think.

That's enough <a href=""http://www.blogskins.com/"">BlogSkins</a> for a little while, aside from maintenance, and <a href=""http://www.whattheysaid.net/"">What They Said</a> shouldn't take too much more time.  So what's next?  I have a few things on the list -- some will be public, and some won't.  And my priorities tend to jump around over time, but I do owe some specific people some things, so that will have to come first.

See you when I'm done.

But for purposes of what I'm about to discuss, here's a short and sweet version: <blockquote>I do reporting for the <a href=""http://cisco.netacad.net/"">Cisco Networking Academy Program</a>.  We have <i>a lot</i> of data and when people want to know something about that data, they come to us.  Diving into the data to figure out how to find what the people want, and how to accurately get it is part of what I do.  The other part is designing and building web-based frontends for the people to look at their data in the way they want to.</blockquote>

I've been at my job for just over two years now, and I've learned a lot about data analysis.  It's actually fun for me now -- drowning myself in data and pulling interesting nuggets out of it.

Those of you who live in states with the <a href=""http://www.powerball.com/"">Powerball</a> game may remember a couple months ago when the jackpot reached $215 million.  Now I don't play the lottery, but the large jackpot got me interested.  And the analyze-the-data mindset I've developed at my job over the years led me to find all the historical data on the Powerball game, load it into a database, and see what I could find out.

Turns out there's all sorts of neat things to be discovered.  Like the fact that no winning number combination has ever been drawn more than once (in fact, the same series of five white balls has never been drawn more than once).  These are the kinds of things I totally geek out on playing with, and the more I played around with the data, the more I realized I needed a tool to poke and prod at it -- rather than writing SQL by hand.

So I give you: <a href=""http://www.powerballers.com/"">Powerballers</a>.  Built using <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.com/"">Ruby On Rails</a>, I was able to develop it in record time.  I don't expect the site to be a big thing, but it was a heck of a lot of fun to develop and hopefully others find it interesting and maybe useful as well.

"Myles Grant","Inspiration Strikes","inspiration_strikes","This post is going to be all over the place, so please watch your step.  Make sure to read to the end though -- that's where the meat is.

Yesterday was my birthday.  I'm now 26.  26 sucks.  25 was fun, what with the quarter century mark and all, but 26 is just 26.  I think it's going to be that way until 29, which will be exciting for the ""ohmygodI'malmost30""-ness of it.  Bah.

Two people I haven't heard from in a very long time sent me emails today.  That was weird.  The only emails I ever get are from mailing lists I'm subscribed to, forwards from my mother, and spam.  Emails from long-lost friends are nice, but they should have coordinated and spread out the love a little, instead of focusing it all on one day.

Like everyone else in the world, I recently finished reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0439784549&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=mylesgrantcom&amp;creative=9325"">Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</a>.  Of course, before I could read that, I had to read books <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0807282596&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=mylesgrantcom&amp;creative=9325"">4</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0807220299&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=mylesgrantcom&amp;creative=9325"">5</a> again because I forgot what happened in them.

Those of you who have read any of the Harry Potter books might recall that one part of all the magic in that world is in the photographs.  Pictures are not just still images... they move.  And some even interact with you.  Of course, much of the world of Harry Potter will never be possible without <i>real</i> magic, but I think that at least a portion of the ""alive"" photograph idea can be.

In fact, I'm kind of surprised no one has done it yet (at least, not that I've heard of).  There <i>are</i> picture frames you can buy these days that will display pictures from digital cameras in a slideshow-like fashion, but no one has taken the next step: displaying video.  If you could take a short, 15 second or so video, and put it on one of those digital picture frames, you'd be pretty damn close to Harry Potter.

Most of the current digital picture frames, besides the still picture limitation, also have another drawback: the method of getting pictures <i>on</i> to the device is limited.  Some have to be <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B0002ZQB7O&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=mylesgrantcom&amp;creative=9325"">plugged into a phone line</a>, and you have to sign in to a website to manage the photos on the frame.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B0007U07F6&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=mylesgrantcom&amp;creative=9325"">Others read the pictures off</a> of the same type of card your camera records them onto.

My dream digital frame would therefore be the following: a choice between the standard 5x7 size and a larger portrait size, multiple frame style choices, <b>the ability to playback video</b>, auto brightness adjust to the light level of the room, high resolution, and wireless connectivity to drag-and-drop photos/videos that you want displayed from another computer.  Bonus: the ability to load and playback photos from <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mylesdgrant/"">Flickr</a>.

With about $2k and a bunch of time, I bet I could build one.  But I'm poor and lazy, so someone make one for me and price it at the $200-$300 level.  K, thnx.

"Myles Grant","Finding an Optimal Refill Strategy","finding_an_optimal_refill_strategy","<p>For some reason or another, I have a tendency to have to do everything in my life in the most efficient way possible.  I'm not sure exactly why... it's just my nature.  It's this tendency that makes me think of things like: ""Would it be more cost effective for me to refill my tank more frequently at lower gas prices than to wait and refill the whole thing at a higher price?""</p>

<p>It's no secret that gas prices have been steadily rising over the past couple years.  And between <a href=""http://www.toyota.com/corolla/"">my fairly fuel efficient car</a>, my relatively short commute, and the fact that otherwise I don't really go... anywhere else, I don't spend as much on gas as I could.  However, is it possible to save more?</p>

<p>Between <a href=""http://www.eas.muohio.edu/"">my Computer Science education</a> and <a href=""/braindump/older/2005/07/11/powerballers.html"">my current job</a> as a reports analyst, my first reaction in these types of situations is <i>to write a simulation program</i>.  So that's what I did.</p>

<p>The short answer? Yes.  The long answer? No.</p>

<p>Let's start with a few assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a 10 gallon tank</li>
<li>I run out of gas every 14 days</li>
<li>Gas price is currently $2.62 a gallon</li>
<li>It increases eight cents a gallon per week</li>
<li>I currently have a full tank</li>
</ul>

<p>Accepting those assumptions as true, we now need two strategies to compare.  Strategy 1 will be: <b>I refill my tank whenever it is empty at the current price.</b>  Strategy 2 will be: <b>I will top off my tank every other day at the current price.</b></p>

<p>Running the simulation for 12 weeks, we get:</p>
<pre>
STRATEGY 1: Refill When Empty...
Week  1: $  0.00
Week  2: $ 27.80
Week  3: $ 27.80
Week  4: $ 57.20
Week  5: $ 57.20
Week  6: $ 88.20
Week  7: $ 88.20
Week  8: $120.80
Week  9: $120.80
Week 10: $155.00
Week 11: $155.00
Week 12: $190.80

STRATEGY 2: Refill Every Other Day...
Week  1: $ 11.42
Week  2: $ 27.11
Week  3: $ 39.22
Week  4: $ 55.83
Week  5: $ 68.62
Week  6: $ 86.14
Week  7: $ 99.62
Week  8: $118.06
Week  9: $132.22
Week 10: $151.57
Week 11: $166.42
Week 12: $186.69

Total savings of STRATEGY 2 over STRATEGY 1: $4.11
</pre>

<p>So I saved $4.11.  Over 12 weeks.  12 weeks of stopping by the gas station every other day, swiping the ol' credit card, removing the gas cap, and topping off the tank (In the 110 degree heat).  I saved $4.11, but I lost it all in the opportunity cost of the time spent refilling.</p>

<p>What if we play with the numbers though?  You have a gas-guzzling SUV that uses 20 gallons of gas every two weeks?  Congrats, you saved $8.23 (it's proportional).  A longer commute causing you to burn through your 10 gallons in a week instead of two?  You only save $3.43.  If gas rises a quarter a week instead of eight cents, then you're saving $12.86, but you probably have other things to worry about at that point.  Even playing with the refill frequency of Strategy 2 doesn't move the numbers substantially in either direction.</p>

<p>I think that pretty much debunks that theory... oh well.  However, I am interested to hear if anyone else has some alternative theories to try.</p>

"Myles Grant","Where Flickr Can Improve","where_flickr_can_improve","For various reasons, I've been thinking a lot about <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/"">Flickr</a> lately.  Flickr says their mission is to <a href=""http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/05/help_wanted.html"">change the world</a>.  A noble purpose to be sure, and completely doable, but to do that you pretty much need to have <i>the world</i> on board.  Flickr already has the professional photographers, the serious amateurs, the A-list bloggers, and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mylesdgrant/117188519/"">the grammar police</a>, but there's still so many more people that they can bring into the fold.  Maybe I'm just a terrible advocate, but for every person I know who uses Flickr, there's still at least 10 that don't even know what it is -- and don't know why they should be using it.

<i>These</i> are the people you change the world with: moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, ""regular"" people (for lack of a better term).  People are busy.  They prioritize their time.  For some of us, checking out the latest web applications is how we spend our time.  Others put that way, way, way down on their list.  So for them to adopt something like Flickr, you need to give them features that make it obvious and simple for them to pick up.  Here are some (free) ideas I've come up with:

<b>1) Email subscriptions</b>
Flickr offers <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/get_the_most.gne#rss"">RSS feeds</a> for all sorts of things: individual photostreams, specific tags, groups, etc.  For those of us in the early adopter group, this is great -- I love the RSS feed of my contacts' photos.  But my mom, for example, doesn't want to, and shouldn't need to, install an RSS reader or use Bloglines <i>just</i> to subscribe to my photo feed.  All she wants to know is when I upload new pictures of <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mylesdgrant/sets/72057594068699444/"">Connor</a>.

For this, Flickr should offer email subscriptions.  Anybody should be able to come along and tell Flickr: ""Email me when this person uploads a new photo.""  No Yahoo/Flickr account required -- just an email address.  It can even be made as complicated as all the feeds, where you can subscribe to email notification when someone uploads with a specific tag or adds a photo to a group.

The technical implementation of such a feature is non-trivial, but Flickr has a history of adding <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/"">innovative, and technically challenging, features</a>.  Certainly there will have to be limitations in place so that Flickr can protect me from drowning in a flood of emails if I subscribe to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/kitten/"">all new Kitten photos</a> -- and perhaps, in that case, protecting me from <i>myself</i>.  Adding this feature allows people to remind themselves to visit Flickr -- and the more they visit Flickr, the more the greatness of the application's other features will become obvious to them.

<b>2) Shared password private photos</b>
Like many social software applications, Flickr allows me to set privacy options on my photos.  In this way, I can either let the public at large see my photos, or just my ""friends"" or my ""family"" (or both).  For a fair amount of photos, Erin and I have decided to make them private -- viewable only by Friends and Family.  But for this to work, all my friends and family need to have Yahoo/Flickr accounts -- and need to be marked, by me, as friends/family.  With an extended family the size of mine, this is... difficult.

Erin and I make use of <a href=""http://www.trixietracker.com/"">Trixie Tracker</a> to keep track of Connor's diapers, sleep, and nursing -- an incredibly valuable service, but not relevant and worthy of a separate post.  But what <i>is</i> relevant is the fact that Trixie Tracker allows me to share our data by defining a password.  I can then give that password to whomever I want, and they don't need to setup a separate account.  In fact, with TT I can set up multiple accounts with different layers of permissions and hand them out -- no action necessary by the people who want to see my private stuff.

Flickr should adopt a similar methodology.  If you know the assigned password, you can view my private photos.  No Yahoo/Flickr account necessary.

<b>3) Account-less print ordering</b>
Flickr's print ordering is flat-out amazing.  Easily the most impressive online ordering system of <i>anything</i>, let alone photos.  It's too bad that for most of my friends/family, this is a feature that's hidden.  That's because in order to order prints -- in order to even <i>see</i> the order prints button -- you need to be signed in to a Flickr account.  In order to more easily impress the masses, the order prints button should be made available (perhaps I can configure this) to everyone.  Then, all they need is a credit card to place an order -- again, no Yahoo/Flickr account necessary.

<b>4) Turn-offable contacts feature and fake-friend feature</b>
This is a feature that's not like the others.  I don't think it's necessary for adoption by the masses, but it is something that I've always wanted.  Like most social-software applications, Flickr has a concept of contacts and ""friends"".  Also like most social-software applications, being added as someone's contact or friend bestows on you some extra functionality -- in Flickr's case, if you're my contact, your new photos show up in my Contacts feed.  If you're my friend, I can see your private photos, and vice-versa.

And like the piece of social-software that we call <i>life</i>, dealing with people who think they're you're friend, but aren't, is... awkward.  In real life, if that friend of a friend, or coworker, that you don't really like invites you over for dinner, or wants to hit a bar, you can always make up an excuse.  But in the social-software world, things are more binary.  If he/she sends you a friend request, it's either yes or no.

What Flickr, and other applications like it, need is some sort of ""fake-friend"" feature.  That way, if someone requests to be your friend, but it would be awkward to turn them down, you can mark them as a fake friend.  To them, it would look like they're your friend, but it would not be reciprocal.  In the case of Flickr, their photos would not show up in my Contacts feed (because I'm not interested in seeing them) and they would not be able to see my private photos (they wouldn't even know I had any, so they wouldn't know what they're missing).

And in order to make Flickr more palatable to people who just want a place to upload and share family photos, and don't want to have to deal with random contact and friend requests, why not make that whole system an option that can be turned on and off?

As you can see, a lot of these have to do with not requiring accounts for various pieces of functionality.  There's nothing <b>wrong</b> with accounts, per se, but they do often get in the way of people just trying out your service.  Especially in instances where certain features... certain <b>amazing</b> features... are completely hidden from users just because they don't have accounts, they can be incredibly detrimental to massive adoption of your application.

Flickr has built what is hands down one of the most impressive web applications to come out in a very long time, and they deserve all the praise and awards they have gotten.  Even if they stopped innovating and adding features, Flickr would still stand tall among all competition.  But with some additional features, like the ones I've suggested and many others that I haven't thought of, Flickr would be well on the way to accomplishing their mission of changing the world.

The previews looked just bizarre but well-done enough to get me to DVR it, but now I'm getting hooked.  In the pilot, I thought that the plot was a little too predictable, a little too long, and a little too overdone.  The second episode was marginally better.  I just finished watching the third, and I'm much happier.  The episode hit the right mix of silliness, overall plot arching, twists, and bizzarity (that's right, bizzarity).

So far they're a little light on the <i>Sci</i> and a little heavy on the <i>Fi</I>, but you can tell that they're at least trying to make things as real as possible while keeping the premise of a town full of geniuses, advanced science, and military-grade weaponry believable.  And there's enough backstory to keep the interest high from episode to episode.  On top of that, the production values are almost ridiculously high, especially for the SciFi channel.

It's not the best show on TV, by any means.  But it's summer, and there's nothing else on (not that that's the only reason I'm watching this show -- it could compete well in the fall).  It will certainly do while I wait (until October!  Frak!) for more <a href=""http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/"">BSG</a>.  If you're interested in catching up in time for next Tuesday's new episode, you can probably find the first three episodes on your favorite P2P network, or let me know, and I can send them to you.

"Myles Grant","Foreign Relations","foreign_relations","<p>At some point in 2003 I decided I'd write a web-based game.  Partly inspired by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Neverending"">GNE</a>, but mostly inspired by too much playing of [some web game I can't remember right now -- it was a turn-based space game with resources and battles and stuff] in college, I'd seen a lot of crappy copycat games pop up, and get popular.  I figured I could do better.  Now I play a lot of <a href=""http://www.urbandead.com/"">Urban Dead</a>, which I probably can't do better than.</p>

<p>The basic idea of <a href=""http://www.foreign-relations.com/"">Foreign Relations</a> is to provide a bit of Risk, Civilization, social networking, all that stuff, while remaining simple and in-browser. No plugins. No fluff.  Casual.</p>

<p>I never worked on it.  Seriously.  It's 2007 and it's not even at alpha-quality yet.  How sad is that?  I'd really like to see it, you know, come to fruition at some point though, and probably the best way to force that is to: a) put it out there, b) get people to try it out, and c) tell me how much it sucks.  Brilliant plan, eh?  Even if it's a little old and crufty.  Even if a lot of the code embarrasses me.  At least get something out there.</p>

<p>So, here we go.  Want to try the ""alpha""?  <a href=""http://alpha.foreign-relations.com/register/?signupKey=51906e73a1ce3bc7"">Sign up here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically this version allows you to sign up, create a nation, buy different military units, communicate with other nations, and attack and defend other nations.  Not a whole lot, but this is the framework on which the rest of the good stuff is built.  The good stuff being: general obvious improvements to how things like attacking and defending work, make the various choices you make when you create a nation have an effect (economic system, political system, etc), formalized enemies/allies, resources that your nation creates and needs (trade), spying, maybe a United Nations type thing?  But the real core of the game that hasn't been built yet is: a random event that would occur every 2 turns, requiring you to make a decision.  And your decision would obviously have consequences.</p>

<p>What am I looking for if you try the game?  Mostly, I'm looking for ideas.  What kinds of decisions would you like to have to make?  What should happen?  What should the economic and political choices do?  Does attacking/defending work well?  What could make it better?  Does your nation make money too fast?  Too slow?  That kind of stuff.  Feel free to post your comments here, or in the forums there, or email me.  And if you don't like it at all, tell me that too.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The game that I played in college and couldn't remember the name of earlier is <a href=""http://www.planetarion.com/"">Planetarion</a>.</p>

Some <a href=""http://www.movabletype.org/"">Movable Type</a> vulnerability or something resulted in a call from my hosting provider, telling me they had to take my site down. Rather than take the steps to fix it, I left it down, and moved on to other things.

In the time since, I've thought about posting one thing or the other to my blog, but the urge was never enough to get me to do anything about it. In the last month or so, however, as the urge grew, I started to take steps to bring it back. I brought the old blog back and updated Movable Type to hopefully block whatever security hole screwed me the first time. But I'm tired of MT and tired of the constant stream of ""New comment posted"" emails that are just spam bot after spam bot.

So I moved to <a href=""http://www.wordpress.org/"">Wordpress</a>. Why Wordpress?

"Myles Grant","Hello Dan","hello-dan","I'm not sure who first directed me to <a href=""http://www.lostgarden.com/"">Lost Garden</a> (probably <a href=""http://iamcal.com/"">Cal</a>), but it's been one of my favorite reads ever since. The game design theory posts are interesting, but <a href=""http://lostgarden.com/labels/prototyping.html"">the prototyping posts</a> are the most inspiring.

After completely skipping over the <a href=""http://lostgarden.com/2007/05/cutegod-prototyping-challenge.html"">CuteGod challenge</a>, I've taken on a couple of the others. I didn't get very far with <a href=""http://lostgarden.com/2007/06/tree-story.html"">Tree Story</a>, as you can see:

But I did get <a href=""http://www.mylesgrant.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/treestory-jump.png"" title=""TreeStory Jumping"">jumping/backflipping done</a> before I lost interest.

Last week Danc posted a new prototyping challenge: <a href=""http://lostgarden.com/2008/02/play-with-your-peas-game-prototyping.html"">Play With Your Peas</a>. After a few days of playing with it on the train, I have most of the editor done:

The hardest parts are still remaining: AI, pathfinding, physics, balance. And I'll probably lose interest well before I get that far. But that's not the point really -- just getting this far has been a lot of fun, and a nice break from what I'm normally working on. Who knows? Maybe in a couple weeks, I'll post a ""finished"" product.","2008-02-18 17:07:59","2008-02-18 17:07:59"

Last year my former neighbor and good friend Brad rode the 2007 <a href=""http://www.aidslifecycle.org/"">AIDS/Lifecycle ride</a>, a 545-mile, 7-day bike ride from San Francisco to LA. As someone who was just getting into cycling at the time, Brad's participation and passionate stories about his experience on the ride inspired me to join him on the ride this year in June.

So I've been training. I ride to and from work every day (with a train ride in between), and on weekends I've been gradually doing longer and longer rides. I'm very lucky to be living on the San Francisco bay peninsula, where there are many, many rides to choose from. So far, training is going well, and I think I'm going to be ready in time.

I have two reasons to do this ride this year:
<ol>
	<li>To help fight HIV/AIDS,</li>
	<li>To participate in a form of exercise that I actually enjoy.</li>
</ol>
#2 is obvious (riding around here is so much better than running on a treadmill). As for #1, I tend not to think about AIDS all that much. I certainly haven't been personally affected by it yet, or know anyone who has. But to hear some of the stories from the AIDS/Lifecycle folks or from Brad, I feel motivated to try and do some small part to end this terrible disease.

I'll obviously be riding a long distance, and to help keep me motivated during that time, I'm asking that you <a href=""http://www.aidslifecycle.org/6327"">please consider donating</a> to support the HIV/AIDS-related services of the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center. Please give them as much as you can, and let's put an end to HIV/AIDS.

<a href=""http://www.aidslifecycle.org/6327"">Thank you. </a>","2008-03-02 21:45:51","2008-03-02 21:45:51"

"Myles Grant","Pixar's movies in order of Metacritic score","pixars-movies-in-order-of-metacritic-score","Erin and I were talking tonight about how no one ever talks about <a href=""http://www.pixar.com/"">Pixar</a>'s <em>A Bug's Life</em>. It wasn't a bad movie, and certainly not the worst movie Pixar's ever made, but it's simply never mentioned as part of Pixar's catalog.

So I decided to look up the scores of all of Pixar's movies on <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/"">Metacritic</a>:
<ol>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/ratatouille"">Ratatouille</a> - 96</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/toystory"">Toy Story</a> - 91</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/incredibles"">The Incredibles</a> - 90</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/findingnemo"">Finding Nemo</a> - 89</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/toystory2"">Toy Story 2</a> - 87</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/monstersinc"">Monsters, Inc</a> - 78</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/bugslife"">A Bug's Life</a> - 77</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/cars"">Cars</a> - 73</li>
</ol>
Which is funny, because my order is:
<ol>
	<li>Toy Story</li>
	<li>The Incredibles</li>
	<li>Monsters, Inc</li>
	<li>Finding Nemo</li>
	<li>A Bug's Life</li>
	<li>Toy Story 2</li>
	<li>Ratatouille</li>
	<li>Cars</li>
</ol>
Which doesn't put A Bug's Life in a very different position, but there's a big gap between 6 and 7 in my list. I really didn't care much for Ratatouille (although Erin did), and I really, <em>really</em> didn't care for Cars.

I have high hopes for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/"">WALL-E</a> though. Perhaps it can take the number 2 or 3 spot?","2008-05-11 21:02:29","2008-05-11 21:02:29"
"Myles Grant","AJ Near Me","aj-near-me","I finally made enough time to play with three things I've been wanting to check out: <a href=""http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/"">Yahoo! Fire Eagle</a>, <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/"">Google App Engine</a>, and <a href=""http://www.authenticjobs.com/api/"">the Authentic Jobs API</a>. The simple and useless result: <a href=""http://ajnearme.appspot.com/"">AJ Near Me</a>.

Let's start with Fire Eagle. Fire Eagle is a location broker -- you use one of the many available methods for it to keep track of your location, and it doles that out to applications to approve. In this case, the idea is that if you're travelling in a new city, and Fire Eagle knows that you're there, you might be interested in what jobs are currently available there. Highly unlikely, I know. And Fire Eagle isn't even really necessary here -- the app could and should simply ask for your current location. My killer app idea that actually uses Fire Eagle properly is automatic tracking of <a href=""http://caltrain.com/"">Caltrain</a> trains and notification of delays via <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/"">Twitter</a>. I'll <em>never</em> get that written, unfortunately.

Google App Engine is an interesting idea: Write your applications to use Google's scalable infrastructure, and they'll host it for free. Currently, it's only available with Python -- something that's certainly not my strong suit. To make things even more potentially frustrating, it's not vanilla Python either, so good luck using any third-party libs that use, say, urllib. Idiosyncrasies inside, I can't pass up free scalable hosting, so I'll probably be using it again in the future (as long as I don't need cron *sigh*).

The AJ API is something I did a few months ago for <a href=""http://cameronmoll.com/"">Cameron</a> and the site. Functionality is pretty basic: get a list of current job listings, filtered by type, keywords, company, etc. One of the bits that I wasn't sure about, but tried anyway was to hook up with the <a href=""http://geonames.org/"">geonames</a> API to parse the user-entered job location bits and turn it into a lat/lon. There's currently no search by lat/lon (but there is a sort of search by location) so this is most of the heavy lifting that the Google App Engine app does.

AJ Near Me maintains a list of current open listings, which it periodically fetches using the AJ API. When you visit the site after granting it permission to read your Fire Eagle location, the site fetches your current location from Fire Eagle. If your location is specific enough, the site searches the local database for all jobs within 50 miles of your location and displays them. Except that's the more difficult part.

Typically, you would create your rough 50 mile bounding box and query the database for records within those four points. Except that in Bigtable, you can't do inequality queries on more than one field at once (I'm serious). So instead, you store your locations as <a href=""http://labs.metacarta.com/blog/27.entry/geographic-queries-on-google-app-engine/"">Geohashes/Geoindexes</a>, convert your lower-left and upper-right bbox points to geoindexes and query the datastore like so:

<blockquote>query = Job.gql(""WHERE location_hash &lt; :right AND location_hash &gt; :left"", left=lower_left_index, right=upper_right_index)</blockquote>

This gets you close, and then you can use <a href=""http://exogen.case.edu/projects/geopy/"">geopy</a>'s great-circle distance calculation function to whittle it down to records actually within 50 miles of your location.

Like I said, a useless idea, but learning about geohashes and bounding box calculations made it worth it. Fire Eagle is a fantastic product and I have high hopes for it -- and about a thousand ideas. Google App Engine can be frustrating, but totally perfect for small projects. I'll be using it again for sure. And if they ever release a PHP version of it, I'll put <a href=""http://www.blogskins.com/"">BlogSkins</a> on it in a heartbeat.","2008-07-26 20:51:31","2008-07-26 20:51:31"
